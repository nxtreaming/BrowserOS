 * Bun entry point for the claw-server server.
 *
 * Binds Hono on 127.0.0.1 — same posture as @browseros/server. The
 * loopback restriction is what lets us run with wildcard CORS and
 * accept `null` Origin requests from the future WXT extension
 * loading via chrome-extension://. No external network reachability.
 *
 * Routes are mounted under `/cockpit` so the URL shape matches what
 * `createCockpitRoutes` produces when the cockpit is embedded inside
 * `@browseros/server`'s mounted runtime (which is the production path). The
 * UI client and agent-mcp-manager harness configs use a single base
 * URL shape (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/cockpit/...`) regardless of
 * which runtime is hosting them, so a profile created against
 * standalone keeps working when the user later switches to the
 * merged runtime on the same port (and vice versa).
 *
 * The claw-app extension reads PROD_API_PORT off the shared port
 * constant; in dev it can pick up an `?apiUrl=` override published
 * by whichever launcher started this process.
