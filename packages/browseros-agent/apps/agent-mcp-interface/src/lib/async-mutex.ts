 * In-process async mutex. Tasks queued via `run` execute one at a
 * time in submission order; subsequent tasks always run, regardless
 * of whether the previous one resolved or rejected.
 *
 * Used by the agents service to serialise slug-mutating operations
 * (create, update, regenerateMcpUrl) so the read-snapshot → compute
 * → write pattern cannot race against itself. The interface server
 * is a single-process loopback bind so per-process serialisation is
 * the right granularity; multi-process scaling would warrant a
 * filesystem-level guard (O_EXCL on a lockfile) instead.
