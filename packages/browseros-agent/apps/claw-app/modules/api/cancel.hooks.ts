 * react-query-kit mutation backing the cockpit's Stop button. Hits
 * `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/cancel`; the server aborts every
 * in-flight tool dispatch on that MCP session and resolves with the
 * count — `cancelled: 0` is a success meaning the session was idle.
 * Missing or already-ended sessions come back 404/409, which the
 * generated client throws as the mutation's error path. The session
 * itself stays open: the agent's harness sees each cancelled dispatch
 * as an isError tool result and is free to fire its next call.
